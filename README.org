~common-app-hightlight~ is an Emacs package that will color buffer text according to the number of characters in the buffer. I made this to use while writing my Common App, which allows only 150 characters in certain form boxes.

* Usage
+ Activate: ~common-app-highlight-enable~
+ Deactivate: ~common-app-highlight-disable~
+ Manually color buffer once: ~common-app-highlight--calc-highlight~
+ *WIP* Set character limit: customize ~common-app-highlight-character-limit~
  
  
* Todos
+ Allow customization of character limit/range
  * Auto-color range/some sort of percentage-wise fit (ex: < 80% of limit gets color X)

~common-app-hightlight~ is an Emacs package that will color buffer text according to the number of characters in the buffer. I made this to use while writing my Common App, which allows only 150 characters in certain form boxes.

* Usage
+ Activate: ~common-app-highlight-enable~
+ Deactivate: ~common-app-highlight-disable~
+ Manually color buffer once: ~common-app-highlight--calc-highlight~
+ *WIP* Set character limit: customize ~common-app-highlight-character-limit~
  
  
* Todos
+ [X] +Allow customization of character limit/range+
+ [ ] Use list for colors, or some math, as well as for numbers
  * dolist instead of cond/setq, is that possible?
